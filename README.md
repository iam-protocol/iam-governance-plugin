# IAM Voter Weight Plugin

SPL Governance voter weight plugin for [IAM Protocol](https://iam-human.io). Gates DAO voting on behavioral proof-of-humanity verification.

## What it does

DAOs on [Realms](https://app.realms.today) can configure this plugin to require members to have a valid IAM Anchor with sufficient Trust Score before casting votes, creating proposals, or participating in governance.

One person, one vote, verified through behavioral consistency over time. No face scans. No document checks. No hardware.

## How it works

1. DAO admin calls `create_registrar` with a minimum Trust Score and maximum verification age
2. Each voter calls `create_voter_weight_record` to initialize their record
3. Before voting, the voter calls `update_voter_weight_record` which reads their IAM IdentityState PDA cross-program and checks:
   - Trust Score >= minimum configured by the DAO
   - Last verification is recent enough (within max_verification_age seconds)
4. If both pass, voter_weight is set to 1 (one person, one vote) with a short expiry (~40 seconds)
5. The governance program reads the VoterWeightRecord and allows the vote

The voter weight expires after ~100 slots, forcing the update to happen in the same transaction as the governance action. This prevents stale weight records from being reused.

## Instructions

| Instruction | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `create_registrar` | DAO admin configures min Trust Score and max verification age |
| `update_registrar` | DAO admin updates configuration parameters |
| `create_voter_weight_record` | Initialize a voter's weight record (born expired) |
| `update_voter_weight_record` | Read IAM IdentityState, validate trust score and recency, set voter_weight = 1 |
| `close_voter_weight_record` | Voter closes their record and reclaims rent |
| `close_registrar` | DAO admin closes the registrar and reclaims rent |

## Architecture

```
Voter wants to cast a vote
    → calls update_voter_weight_record
    → plugin reads IAM IdentityState PDA (cross-program, no CPI)
    → checks trust_score >= min_trust_score
    → checks verification age < max_verification_age
    → sets voter_weight = 1, expiry = current_slot + 100
    → governance program reads VoterWeightRecord
    → vote is accepted
```

The plugin reads the IAM IdentityState account via raw byte deserialization (not Anchor CPI) to avoid version coupling with the IAM Anchor program.

## Program ID

**Devnet:** `99nwXzcugse3x8kxE9v6mxZiq8T9gHDoznaaG6qcw534`

## Build

```bash
anchor build
```

Requires:
- Anchor 0.31.1
- Solana CLI 2.2.1
- Rust 1.91.0

## Test

```bash
# Generate test fixtures (one-time)
npx tsx scripts/generate-test-fixtures.ts

# Start local validator with genesis programs and fixture accounts
solana-test-validator \
  --bpf-program 99nwXzcugse3x8kxE9v6mxZiq8T9gHDoznaaG6qcw534 target/deploy/iam_voter_weight.so \
  --bpf-program GZYwTp2ozeuRA5Gof9vs4ya961aANcJBdUzB7LN6q4b2 tests/fixtures/iam_anchor.so \
  --bpf-program GovER5Lthms3bLBqWub97yVrMmEogzX7xNjdXpPPCVZw tests/fixtures/spl_governance.so \
  --account 63cKuvoe9WuNH9Ds6aXF7iSc4jHmJc4ZkxdHTaitJ5tr tests/fixtures/identity-state-a.json \
  --account 73gAPp8WuNzdHh4E5ySQNFR3jpw8qs5YFaYPp8iyt6FZ tests/fixtures/identity-state-b.json \
  --reset --quiet

# Run all tests (in a separate terminal)
npx ts-mocha -p ./tsconfig.json -t 120000 tests/**/*.ts
```

35 tests: 20 unit tests (byte layout, PDA derivation, validation logic) + 15 integration tests (real transactions against local validator with IAM Anchor and spl-governance loaded as genesis programs).

## Dependencies

| Crate | Version | Purpose |
